## 💡 Project Overview

The **Smart-Energy-System** project integrates solar panels, battery management, and real-time data monitoring into a smart energy solution. The system uses solar panels to convert sunlight into electrical energy, which charges a 5V battery. The battery powers Arduino and connected peripherals through a boost module. The Arduino monitors and displays the battery and load data, while the **INA226 module** tracks the battery and load voltage, current, and power.
